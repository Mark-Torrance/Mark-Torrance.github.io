    <div class="article-content">
      <p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of time preparing blogs in my head over the last six months or so. I am lucky enough to be involved in several different projects, with lots of excellent people. Quite a bit of what we do hasn&rsquo;t and probably won&rsquo;t make it into journal papers. Underneath the smooth (we like to think) surface of our papers there is nearly always technical, difficult, challenging, time consuming, and sometimes frantic, paddling. In many ways, this is the real scientific contribution of what we do, not the glossy end product. Hence this blog. Or what will be this blog if I actually get my act together to write some of this stuff down.</p>

<p>In a vain (and possibly also vain) attempt at forcing my own hand, I&rsquo;m going to list some of the blog posts that I&rsquo;ve been preparing in my head. In no particular order. In fact, you can influence order. If there&rsquo;s stuff below that you particularly want to hear about, let me know.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Using GazePoint GP3 eye trackers &ndash; which cost less that 1k GBP &ndash; in conjunction with PsychoPy and ioHub to create sophisticated gaze-contingent cognitive experiments</strong>. There are lots of situations where the accuracy of a cheap eye tracker is all you need. We are at the beginning stages of using a GP3 with young children, but crucially we&rsquo;ve got it working, via PsychoPy (free Python libraries for developing behavioural experiments) and ioHub - free Python libraries for making PsychoPy even better. Programming effectively and efficiently with PsychoPy and ioHub takes a bit of time and effort, though, even if you&rsquo;re reasonably Python-competent. I plan to talk you through our solution.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Writing PsychoPy with Excel, and nothing else</strong>. We - well I say we, but actually the excellent Sol Simpson, in discussion with me - have developed at thing called simplePET. One trial is a row in an Excel spreadsheet. You define what you want your subject to see and hear, and what data you want to collect - keypress, digitising tablet input, eye movement.</p></li>

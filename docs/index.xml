      <description>My name is Mark Torrance. My research explores the cognitive and educational psychology of text production: How our minds turn ideas into text - letters, words, sentences, blog posts - on the screen or page, and how best to teach children to do this well. Quite a bit of my time is taken up with developing methods for capturing writing processes as they unfold in real time.
I belong to the Psychology Department at Nottingham Trent University, but am borrowed - to considerable personal benefit - by the Norwegian National Reading Centre at University of Stavanger and by Raquel Fidalgo, and co-researchers at University of Le√≥n.</description>

My name is Mark Torrance. I belong to the Psychology Department at Nottingham Trent University, but am frequently borrowed - to considerable personal benefit - by the Norwegian National Reading Centre at University of Stavanger and by Raquel Fidlago, and co-researchers at University of Le√≥n. My research explores the cognitive and educational psychology of text production: How our minds turn ideas into text - letters, words, sentences, blog posts - on the screen or page, and how best to teach children to do this well. Quite a bit of my time is taken up with developing methods for capturing writing processes as they unfold in real time.

On the off-chance that anyone who doesn't already know me wants to get in touch then mark.torrance at ntu.ac.uk Or if you want to tell the world that I'm wrong, or right, or could do better - and you should - then [@mark_torrance](http://twitter.com/mark__torrance). If you follow me you'll get new-post notifications. You won't be bothered often.
